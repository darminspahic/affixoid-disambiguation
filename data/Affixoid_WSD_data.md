The complex words (i.e. affixoid formations and regular compounds) were judged for word sense by groups of raters contracted through the platform Prolific Academic (https://prolific.ac/).

Each survey presented the raters with a total of 200 test items and interspersed among them 20 gold items.
Each survey had 20 blocks of 11 items each, where one item per block was a gold item whose correct label was known. 

Each block of items was presented on a single web-page as a table where the 21 items appeared on the rows and the word senses for the affixoid candiate appeared as the column labels. Raters were asked to select one of the senses for each item in a forced choice setting, i.e. they could not abstain. 
The sense inventory was predefined but the raters also had two additional options: they could either say that the needed sense was missing, or that they found the item's meaning incomprehensible.

After each survey's data was collected, several ways to compute a single label for each instance were used:
- simple majority vote (sense that was assigned by most raters)
- qualified majority vote (details to follow)
- mace: sense label assigned by MACE tool https://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-sw/mace/

In most cases, the three above methods agreed. For the cases of disagreement, an expert annotator went over all those items where the senses assigned by the qualified majority vote and mace did not agree and adjudicated these senses.
